‚úÖ Project Summary
You‚Äôre building a Web3-native trading and portfolio platform (inspired by Zerodha), with:

Tech Stack
Backend: Python + FastAPI

Frontend: React

Database: PostgreSQL

Blockchain Layer: Smart contracts (planned, using Hardhat)

Caching/Queue: Redis (optional/future)

APIs: REST + WebSocket

External Services: CoinGecko, Web3 providers

Architecture
Microservices planned:

Authentication (legacy + wallet login)

Portfolio Service

Trading Service

Notification Service

Design patterns and LLD to be detailed per module

üöß Current Progress / Project Stage
‚úÖ Folder structure initialized

‚úÖ Docker Compose set up with:

PostgreSQL container

pgAdmin UI container

‚úÖ CI/CD Plan defined (GitHub Actions, Docker-based, with future AWS ECS support)

‚ùå No backend, frontend, or smart contracts created yet

üìÑ Some documentation and HLD in place

üß≠ What Should We Do Next?
Here's a recommended order of next steps:

1. Set Up Backend Skeleton (FastAPI)
Create a new service in /backend directory

Add Dockerfile for the backend

Scaffold FastAPI with a basic /health route

Connect it to the Docker Compose network (add to docker-compose.yml)

Optionally connect it to PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM)

2. CI/CD Initial Setup
Create .github/workflows/backend.yml

Run linting (flake8) and tests (pytest)

Build Docker image for backend

Push to container registry (optional for now)

3. Smart Contract Boilerplate
Initialize Hardhat project in /contracts

Add basic setup: sample contract, test, deploy script

(Optional) Create Dockerfile for contract testing

4. Frontend Skeleton (React)
Create basic React app in /frontend

Add Dockerfile for React

Serve simple "Coming Soon" page

Prepare for CI with eslint and jest

5. Documentation Continuation
Define API contracts (OpenAPI or Swagger)

Flesh out microservice responsibilities (LLD folder)

Define interactions with smart contracts
